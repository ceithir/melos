*Playing with some possible flows for the discussion
  Quite clich√© and obviously rushed as hell for now. Still experimenting to get the right personalities and mannerisms for the characters.

*Started this CHANGELOG (better late than never)
*Added a new "chapter" to the raw text draft
  This is not the logical follow-up of the first introduction draft, but a distinct scene later on in the adventure. I'm trying to get a better grasp of the characters' personalities by working first on some important moments, then split, order, rearrange, complete them later on. Not something I usually do, but I wanted to try it there.
