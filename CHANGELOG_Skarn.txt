*Finally an update!
  Did a route completely
  Sew the seeds of many others
  Am damn late
  Am not really convinced by what I wrote

*Reworked on the first dialog between Ambrosia and Antiope
  Now far less emotional
  Really need to find a cool way to drop Antiope's name soon or I'm going to turn mad

*After a long weekend trying to write something good a lot and succeeding little, I finally reworked the introduction in a way which pleases me
  Better rhythm for the introduction, less dumping, more feelings
  Psychology of Ambrosia reworked, stress, pressure put forwards, almost self-destructive obsession suggested
  I somehow haven't dropped Antiope name up there. And the reveal of Ambrosia's own one feels forced. Names are precious and powerful, they should be treated with more care.

*Playing with some possible flows for the discussion
  Quite clich√© and obviously rushed as hell for now. Still experimenting to get the right personalities and mannerisms for the characters.

*Started this CHANGELOG (better late than never)
*Added a new "chapter" to the raw text draft
  This is not the logical follow-up of the first introduction draft, but a distinct scene later on in the adventure. I'm trying to get a better grasp of the characters' personalities by working first on some important moments, then split, order, rearrange, complete them later on. Not something I usually do, but I wanted to try it there.
