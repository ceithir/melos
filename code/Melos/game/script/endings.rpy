    "I feel bad, nauseous, stiff. My head is heavy, aching, my mouth furred, my throat hurting. I sense a hand on my shoulder, two fingers tapping repeatedly on my forehead. Reluctantly, I open my eyes, painfully, and the darkness recesses."

    #Music? Background?

    "I am lying in an unknown seat, folded in an uncomfortable position, one arm as a pillow. My hair and my dress are competing with each other for the position of most messy, but that's probably only because I cannot see my face. But I can see {i}her{/i}."

    "She seems tired, but yet is ready for departure, fully clothed and equipped. Her eyes are filled with concern as she hands me a flask of water. I accept mechanically, drink a little. The fresh liquid dissipates part of my forgetful stupor, revealing the terrible reality."

    "I remember delaying, postponing, pushing back, assuring myself I would go after that last song, that last cup, my will to move actually decreasing as time passed on and alcohol filled up my body. I don't know which of my mind or my organism forfeited first, but at some point my memories cease. I suppose – hope – I have drunk myself to sleep."

    "I stand, feeble on my feet, and excuse myself pitifully. I ask her to wait for me while I fetch my belongings and I run away."

    "A few minutes later, after a lighting flash toilette, I'm back and ready to go. I do a bad joke about not knowing my own limits and them we move on. In the end, the cold facts are that we have a long trip ahead of us, and we already are several hours behind our schedule."

    "As the walk goes on under the light on the sun, she starts shining, the physical effort purifying her body, her pace sure and quick, her cheeks pinkish from the extra ardor put into the back-and-forth sprints she regularly does for scouting ahead. She quickly is as radiant as ever, if not more."

    "Me? I'm slow, gloom and depressed. Not only do I not emit any light, but I'm unable to simply reflect it like I usually do. I right now cannot play properly my own role in the play which is my life, cannot force myself to fit the mood, to drape my insignificance in the brilliance of others to make it looks like I glow a little. I'm in broad daylight, yet I'm what I really am in the dark, once stripped of the clouds of facilitating lies I usually wear as a second skin."

    "I'm myself. A coward. An actor afraid of herself, afraid of letting her audience look beyond the mask. Able to speak the most complicated, lyrical, convoluted, impressive sentences as long as they're perfectly useless, but suddenly mute as soon as the truth may come out of my lips. A highly educated, perfectly trained master of form without substance."

    "And that's exactly why I need to rebuild the illusion immediately, before anyone realizes it's a fake and could confront me on what I really am. So, I take a deep breath, readjust my posture, reorder my hair, compose myself a \"happy but tired\" smile and a couple of seconds later, the veil is back on."

    "I can already fool the world outside, and I'm sure I will soon be able to fool myself into thinking this was just a missed opportunity, that another will arise and that this time I will find the necessary courage."

    "A white lie to keep myself sane."

    "Still a lie."
