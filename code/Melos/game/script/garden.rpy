    "I know I must stop her before she really harms herself. However, once more, I'm hesitation on the \"how\"."

    "Yet, when she finishes her current dish and tries to grab the carafe one more time, I instinctively react. I catch the recipient myself and push it out of her reach. Her fingers close on the emptiness, and she bats an eyelid, disconcerted by this interruption of her freshly forged ritual."

    ambrosia "You've had enough I think."

    "My voice is soft, gentle. I force myself to look at her right into the eyes and to appear both kind and firm. I'm pretty sure this is too much for my acting skills, but I try nonetheless."

    "Antiope is still disturbed. She looks down at her food, but I put my open hand under her stare, like a barrier between her and the remaining snacks."

    ambrosia "That's. Enough."

    "Her face goes up again, and we look at each other. She is in a worst state that I thought. She seems absent, lost."

    "Then suddenly she rises from her seat and starts stumbling in an apparently random direction."

    "Seeing her in pain, I immediately stand up and help her. My left arm around her shoulders, I guide her to a calmer and cooler location. I can feel her weight pushed upon me for lack of ability to support herself alone, her erratic, hot, wine-laden breath against my neck, her moist skin under my palm. She is already quite sick."

    scene

    "We laboriously walk together, trying not to bump into anybody, until we are finally met by the fresh air of the outside. A beautiful garden reveals itself before us, the plants, either medicinal or decorative, crowned with a surreal gray aura, the light of the moon in the darkness playing with the small layer of dew covering leaves and corollas."

    "The place was full of people earlier, but many hours have passed since, the night is now at its worst hours, and the area is now deserted. There is a bench nearby, alongside a fountain, and I drag Antiope there. The stone is slightly humid, extremely cold, and I worry that letting her lie on it could be an incredibly stupid idea. But before I can move elsewhere, she just collapses there, trying to sit but ending lying on her back."

    "I rush to her side, but she stops me with a vindicative gesture of the hand, and straightens herself up through her own efforts. Her face is transfigured with rage, but against who or whom, only the gods know. She forces her own body to stand up again and walks a few steps away in the green."

    "There she throws up."

    "After that, she goes for the fountain, a little more steady on her feet, and washes her face in the icy water. Finally, she rests on the bench, properly sit this time. She looks {i}better{/i}, but she certainly does not look {i}fine{/i}. She at least has the decency of appearing embarrassed when she finally talks to me."

    antiope "I may have overdone it."

    "Anger fills me in. The most painful, burning, self-destructive variety. The kind only felt when someone dear to you endanger themselves without realizing how much their loss would affect those who love them.{w}\n\nI love Antiope with all my heart. And that's why at this very moment, I'm more furious than the three Erinyes together."

    ambrosia "Yes. Yes you did."

    "Antiope looks shocked. She is not used to seeing me angry, and especially not at her. She tries to calm down the game."

    antiope "I didn't realize I had already drunk so much. We celebrated a first time after the morning games and..."

    ambrosia "Antiope! That's not the problem."

    "I almost yelled the last sentence. I am furious."

    ambrosia "That's not the first time that happened! You eat and you drink as if trying to kill yourself by choking! I don't care about your traditions, this is just sick."

    "She stares at me with empty eyes. Stammers a few syllables. Stands up. Go to the pond. Splashes her face with cold water. Returns to the bench. Sits up again, looking a little better this time. And answers."

    antiope "Have you heard of this Spartan story with the fox?"

    "The unexpected change of topic troubles me for a second, but she does not sound like she is trying to simply avoid the conversation, so I respond as calmly as I'm currently able to."

    ambrosia "The one where a little boy would rather have his insides rip apart by the fox he stole than to be caught red-handed? Yes, I know of it."

    antiope "Yes, that one. What do you think of it?"

    ambrosia "A gory tale tailored for a quick spread and a long-lasting legacy. Bloody, violent, shocking, everything a good urban legend needs to endure. It can also be interpreted as much as a tribute to the courage of Spartans as a denunciation of the cruelty of their education methods, and thus is told by both admirers and the enemies of this city."

    antiope "Ever thought it could be based on a true story? That's such a boy may have existed?"

    ambrosia "Actually... No. I don't think it's something that really happened. But it probably takes root in some real Spartan customs."

    antiope "Yes. It's a believable tale, because teaching how to steal to your future soldiers is actually a pretty rounded idea."

    "Antiope is speaking quickly, too quickly, each word mashing with the next, her accent more pronounced than ever."

    antiope "A marching army is made of thousands of people, all needing to eat. And most often than not, for most of the troops, after a few days, all their rations are gone and they have to live off the land. A ridiculous euphemism for stripping bare any field, any tree, any granary, any house."

    antiope  "For a nobody in such cohorts, the art of soulless plundering is perhaps more important than knowing how to handle your weapon. The main fight may never come for many stupid or noble reasons, but your stomach still aches every day."

    antiope "And, sometimes, an expedition can turn {i}really{/i} bad. The war may trail for so long that literally every edible thing around has already be ransacked. Despite the absence of real fighting, each new day brings in its share of cadavers as more and more people die from the many diseases corrupted water and rotten food bring. Apollo's wrath is far more mortal than any of Ares' bloodsheds."

    antiope "And to make things even worse, the suffering army can then be crushed utterly regardless of its many sacrifices, pushed into a retreat so chaotic that many small isolated groups are left behind, and must now make their way back on their own, in hunger and fear. For a perfect agony, you can even add some rain or snow."

    antiope "A lot more will die. But quite a number will also somehow survive. Among them, some will have sacrificed all morality, decency, humanity to escape the sirens of Inferno. They succeeded in returning to their home, but they will never be the same, their behavior forever changed."

    "Antiope suddenly stops talking and shuts her mouth tight. Her face shows a myriad of terrible expressions at once, hate, anger, fear, shame. She clings on her seat with both hands and applies such strength to it that she would probably crush it was it not made of stone. Her eyes are bottomless pit of darkness."

    "I hold my breath. I never saw her like that, and I'm actually terrified. She is right now a cornered beast, and I fear for what could happen with the wrong word, the wrong movement."

    "I remain like this for several minutes, thinking about what happened, about the consequences of these events. But I'm too tired to properly put the pieces together and solve the riddle. So, I myself just go back to the building, my mind full of contradictory thoughts and feelings."

    "Antiope's reaction is as immediate as terrible. Her fingers instantly lock on my wrist with a bestial strength. She pushes back my arm like she was deflecting some sword blow, getting to her feet in the same movement. My heart starts beating furiously, from raw fear. I see death in her eyes, an unsheathed killing instinct."

    ambrosia "Antiope, please stop!"

    "My voice is a desperate plea. Panic gets the better of me, overriding all my conscious thoughts. I don't know what to do, but I'm trying to do it regardless, my whole body shaking."

    "I see Antiope's fist ready to strike, but before she throws it, the gods be thanked, some reason returns to her mind. She abruptly releases me. I immediately move back a few steps, my hurt wrist pressed against my chest, the skin having turned red where she pressed it."

    "And then I run. I run in the night, I run back to the building, back to the light and the people. I hide myself among all these anonymous persons, in constant movement, always out of sight. I don't know if she followed me, and I don't want to know if she did. I just want to be as far as possible from her, yet I refuse to go out while she may be somewhere out there."
